# Learning Objective - Creating Prototypes


* Prototypes facilitate conversations
* Prototypes make the conversation the emphasis
* Interactive prototypes - it has some interaction (people can try it out and get a feel for it). Uses fake data
* No chance to get your initial design right
* Prototypes allow you to pivot easily based off of user feedback.


## Storyboards

1. thinking about user tasks

## Paper Prototypes

1. thinking about user interactions

## Visual Design

1. Making it look pretty. Maybe get a designer to make good aesthetics and visuals. This part is third because you don't want people to bikeshed and waste time on things like typography or font. You want the emphasis to first be the core functionality.

## Interactive Prototypes

1. Picky usability details.


## Storyboards (again)

1. Lowest fidelity prototype you can possibly make
2. A hand-drawn comic that features: setting + sequence + satisfaction.
3. Setting - people involved, environment, task being accomplished.
4. Sequence - what steps involved, what leads someone to use the app, what task is being illustrated?
5. Satisfaction - what's the motivation to the user?

#### Benefits
 - Focuses the conversation and feedback on user tasks.
 - Gets everyone on same page about the app's goals.
 - Avoids nitpicking about user interface. FOCUS ON FUNCTIONALITY!
 - Shows the entire story of how a user goes from their needs to actual satisfaction.


## Paper Prototypes (again)

1. A hand-drawn UI (usually) on multiple sheets of paper.
2. You can photocopy your hand-drawn components, but don't create anything on the computer.
